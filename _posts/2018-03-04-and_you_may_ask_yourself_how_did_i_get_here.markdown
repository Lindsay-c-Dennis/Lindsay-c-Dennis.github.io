Ten years ago, I graduated from a small liberal arts college in rural Iowa with a BA in Psychology. Armed with a fancy new piece of paper and dreams of grandeur, I stepped out into the workforce. Coincidentally, at that same moment, the bottom fell out of the US economy. You win some, you lose some.

In the intervening years, I’ve done residential home construction, sold chewable probiotic tablets, built organic gardens in public schools, driven a pedicab through the streets of the French Quarter, and led historic bicycle tours across the city of New Orleans. An ungenerous person might call my career path rudderless. I prefer the term ‘eclectic’.

But I’m in my 30s now, which means I’m ready to trade Glitter and Whimsy for exciting things like health insurance, financial stability, and retirement savings. 

In the past, I’ve chosen jobs that gave me the opportunity to learn and build new skills, but I’ve pretty consistently reached a point a couple years in where I am no longer intellectually challenged, and I start to get restless. Many of these jobs also required a lot of social and emotional labor that I found incredibly draining. I knew that I needed to find a real career path, doing something that challenged me, where I could continue learning throughout my life, and where having a bit of social anxiety wouldn’t be a huge professional roadblock.

You see where I’m headed with this?

I first got the idea to look into coding bootcamps after seeing an advertisement for a local nonprofit called Operation Spark that runs in-person immersives. I attended a couple of free classes with them, and began exploring free coding resources through freecodecamp and codecademy. Through these resources, I discovered an interest in coding, and working with technology started to seem like a real possibility. While I don’t have the incredible passion for computers that my brother seemed to be born with (he’s now a software engineer at Oracle), I loved the process of figuring out how to build functions and troubleshoot issues. I’ve always had a knack for managing logistics and anticipating problems. I saw that software development could open a lot of doors, and that it was something that would be consistently challenging. I was hooked.

I considered the in-person immersive at Operation Spark, but faced some pretty serious sticker shock. $12,000? I’d spent the last two years telling tourists about pirates. On a scale from 1 to lucrative, that lands somewhere north of ‘Eh, you won’t starve.’ $12,000 was...impractical. So I started researching my options. I went to Course Report to look up the best coding bootcamps and the best scholarships, and discovered a delightful overlap in the Flatiron School (see? You really do win some.)

I completed most of the free bootcamp prep coursework before taking the jump and applying for the online web developer program with the Women Take Tech scholarship. I LOVE this scholarship, not just because it’s pretty much the only reason I’ve been able to pursue this training without going into debt. I love it because it means that this school cares about bringing women into fields that sorely need them. It’s no secret that tech is widely perceived to be a Boy’s Thing, as though the Y chromosome comes pre-loaded with the Ruby library (at puberty, they get the nokogiri gem!) There is nothing about programming that is inherently daunting to the female brain, but these cultural perceptions have real ramifications. I know for a fact that I would be more intimidated in my courses if I were surrounded by men, and I’m certainly not alone in that. But the Flatiron school student body is diverse and supportive, which has helped me dedicate all of my energy to learning instead of getting mired down in imposter syndrome.

So why programming? Why not? I’m smart, I like tinkering, it’s fun, and it prepares me for a constantly evolving work world that is increasingly reliant on computers and technology.  Plus, I already love funny cat pictures and Monty Python, so I imagine I’ll fit right in.
