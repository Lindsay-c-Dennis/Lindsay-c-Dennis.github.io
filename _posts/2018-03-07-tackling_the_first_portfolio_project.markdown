When I hit the ‘next lesson’ button and landed on the CLI Data Gem Project lesson, a small jolt of panic rushed through me. Going into the Flatiron program, I knew that I would have to complete five of these portfolio projects, I just kind of figured that the me that started these projects would be smarter and better prepared than...well, me.

Reading through the project expectations didn’t do much to assuage my panic, although I did appreciate the assurances at the end that I would not be scolded. I love not being scolded! Still, there was a long list of things I’d have to accomplish before I could get to the other side, and my imposter syndrome was beginning to rear its ugly head. I would have to create an entire file tree! I would have to include all the ‘require’s and ‘require_relative’s to make sure my files could communicate with each other and the necessary gems were functional! I would have to write a functional program and correctly use nokogiri! I would have to record videos of myself coding and giving a walkthrough of my program! And, I would have to do it all on my local environment - a six-year-old laptop running a Linux OS.

It all seemed a bit...daunting. I landed on this lesson in the middle of the day on Friday, and I spent the entire afternoon watching the associated videos. Over the weekend, I brainstormed ideas and attended a study group. By Monday morning, I had no more excuses - I had to get started.

Fortunately, a lot of the things that scared me about this project turned out to be pretty easy, all because of a miraculous little program called bundler. With a little bit of trial and error, I was able to install all the necessary gems on my computer, include all the requisite requirements in my files, and get started. A couple of times, I felt like I was running straight into a wall and couldn’t understand what was going wrong. Fortunately, Flatiron had technical coaches available to help me work through it. Jonathan assured me that it’s ok if I swear a little in my 30 minute coding video (just not the walkthrough!). When I worried that there was no way I’d ever make it through this project, Sara looked through my code and helped me find that all I needed was to add a local variable and things would work. The next morning, I had worked myself into a serious brain fog trying to figure out how to juggle classes and add the functionality I wanted. I did a 1:1 with Corinna, and she helped me realize that I was making things too hard on myself. Based on her input, I simplified my approach and created a nice, clean program. Every coach I’ve talked to has been so supportive and affirming, which has been invaluable in helping me conquer my imposter syndrome. I can do this!

I now have a functional CLI gem that caters to my esoteric interests! I love listening to comedy podcasts, and my favorite network is Maximum Fun. So I created a gem that scrapes their website to produce a list of comedy podcasts, then allows the user to view more detail on each individual podcast. I even added a little Easter egg for my favorite podcast.

I haven’t yet scheduled my review, and I do still feel some anxiety about that, but I feel so much more on top of things than I did just a few days ago. Fingers crossed, it will all go swimmingly!
